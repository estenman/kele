# Kele

The goal of the project was to create a Ruby Gem API client that can be used to provide easy access to and use of the student endpoints of Bloc's API.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

You will need to have Ruby on Rails installed.

## Running the tests

Use IRB to test. To initiate enter `require './lib/kele'` it will return true. To create a client you can use `Kele.new("insert valid email", "insert password for the user")`.
